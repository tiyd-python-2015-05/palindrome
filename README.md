# palindrome.py

## Description
A simple script to test if user-supplied text is a palindrome using 3 
different methods, ignoring case and any non-letter characters or punctuation.
This script uses string substitution with regular expressions to clean text,
as well as recursive and iterative versions of the palindrome checking function.

### Requirements  
* Python 3
* (Optional) The included test suite (`test.sh`) requires roundup (`brew install roundup` for OSX)


## Notes
Letter casing and punctuation do not matter when testing a palindrome. All of the following are valid palindromes:

* stunt nuts
* Lisa Bonet ate no basil.
* A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal: Panama!
* Doc, note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.
